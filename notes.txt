DEPLOY**********


-> Mongo Atlas is what we are going to use here.

-> Create a Mongo Atlas account
-> upon creating the account now make a cluster which is free and shared.
-> From Database access Add new Database with username new-user-117 and password: ZuNF33rT6TV2ek7U
-> Use read and write only and rest to default.

-> Then click Network access and add an IP address.
-> There I just add our current IP address and confirm (********* add access from anywhere since our current IP doesnt 
work here *********)
-> And then we need to connect to my cluster. then we need to specify how we want to connect and we will connect it 
through an application. we connect node and basically this will give us an url. we copy the url.
(mongodb+srv://new-user-117:<password>@cluster0.ygqixms.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority) and I'm gonna put 
that in my .env file and in password I'm going to put my actual password and save it as DB_URL.

-> Then in my app.js we will use process.env.DB_URL as the dbUrl and call it when I'm connecting to mongoose.
-> We will see in our console mongoose connected then in our YELPCAMP we wont see any campgrounds and that's good
news. that is the database we created for production purpose for deploying to hiroku or wherever we want to deploy.
as for now we will use mongoose connection locally and comment out dbUrl. 


#### Using Mongo as our Session Store

npm i connect-mongo   ---> installl

-> require it in app.
-> use MongoStore before creating session and use mongoUrl, secret and touchAfter(for lazy sessions). 
Read the docs -------->  https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-mongo

-> Then for any session errors store.on any error and console.log those errors.
-> pass the store into our sessionConfig where we created session. 
-> Now in our mongoDB yelp-camp database we see a collection of sessions been created by mongo. they have expiry 
date automatically expire after 7days of session creation.


##### Heroku Setup

-> DEPLOYMENT APP 
( https://www.heroku.com/ )
-> Create an account

-> After account creation install Heroku CLI. 
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#install-the-heroku-cli
